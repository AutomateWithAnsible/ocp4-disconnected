# There are a handful of operators that are shipped as a single yaml file
# named bundle.yaml
# The registry operators expects the operators to be broken up into individual
# componet yaml files for
# - CSV (Cluser Serivce Version) and
# - CRD (Custom Resource Definition)
#
# This playbook finds all the bundled operators and unbundles them
# Once unbundled the bundle.yaml file will be deleted.
